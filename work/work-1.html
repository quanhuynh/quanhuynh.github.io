<h5 class="text-left">Lorem Ipsum Post is my first web design project. It was meant as a tool for my learning. Lorem Ipsum Post resembles a home page of a mock news site, with features including a clean navigation bar, featured articles and latest news, and card-style sections.</h5>
<h5 class="text-left">I coded the page from scratch with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and the Bootstrap framework. I hope to be going back and improving the project as I learn more about web development.</h5><img src="../../assets/img/work/work-1/img4.png" alt="Lorem Ipsum Post"/>
<h5 class="text-left">The project can be found <a href="http://quanhuynh.github.io/news_site_template"> here </a></h5><img src="../../assets/img/work/work-1/img2.png" alt="Lorem Ipsum Post"/>
<h5 class="text-left">I also attempted to make the site mobile responsive, but it still needs to be optimized. </h5><img src="../../assets/img/work/work-1/img3.png" alt="Lorem Ipsum Post"/>
