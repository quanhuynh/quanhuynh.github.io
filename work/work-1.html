<h3 class="text-left"><strong> About </strong></h3>
<h5 class="text-left">PresentText is a Google Chrome extension that allows the user to put highlighted text into focus on a page and dims the light on the rest of the page. This allows for easy, distraction-free reading or for an actual presentation, where focus is needed on only a small passage.</h5>
<h5 class="text-left">Currently, I've only built the core functionality of PresentText, which includes the on/off functionality, layering a dark cover over the page, and smooth transitions. I plan to bring multiple colors and opacity options to the extension soon.</h5><img src="../../assets/img/work/work-1/img3.jpg" alt="PresentText"/>
<h3 class="text-left"><strong> Design and Implementation </strong></h3>
<h5 class="text-left">I wanted the extension to be quick and easy to use, so that two simply clicks would start the extension. An icon is built into Chrome browser when the user installs the extension, and it opens a smaller window with presentation options. The user can then start a session.</h5>
<h5 class="text-left">A PresentText session is dynamic. Whenever the user highlights a text passage, the remaining window of the browser is darkened with a low-opacity black layover, so that the highlighted portion appears bright. The layover is implemented with basically four rectangles, covering left, right, top, and bottom of the screen except for the highlighted portion.</h5>
<h5 class="text-left">PresentText is built on JavaScript</h5><img src="../../assets/img/work/work-1/img2.jpg" alt="PresentText"/>
<h3 class="text-left"><strong> What I Learned </strong></h3>
<h5 class="text-left">Since the project was entirely built in JavaScript, it was a great opportunity for me to get acquainted with the language. I also learned the details of making a Chrome extension. It's a whole different corner of programming in my opinion.</h5>
<h5 class="text-left">The extension is not publicly available yet, since I would like to make it a bit more smooth, but if you would like to check out the source code, visit my <a href="http://github.com/quanhuynh/PresentText"> <strong> Github repository</strong></a>.</h5>
