<h5 class="text-left">When I first started programming, I started contributing to a project called the Daily Programmer. It was a series of online coding challenges at different levels for learning or just for fun. For me it was both. I continued working on my personal Daily Programmer portfolio, and all of my projects can be found on my Github.</h5>
<h5 class="text-left">The portfolio includes many things, from easy projects for me to get used to a new language, to a simulator or a game. I have also taken inspiration from many topics and expanded them into my own projects.</h5>
<h5 class="text-left">For example, the first image you saw above was my personal interactive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life"> Conway's Game of Life </a> simulator. I had a lot of fun making and using it. It runs a Conway's Game of Life simulation but the user can determine which cell dies or lives at any given time.</h5><img src="../../assets/img/work/work-3/img2.gif" alt="Game of Life"/>
<h5 class="text-left">This particular project can be found <a href="https://github.com/quanhuynh/DailyProgrammer/tree/master/other/conways-game-of-life"> here </a></h5><img src="../../assets/img/work/work-3/img3.jpg" alt="Minesweeper"/>
<h5 class="text-left">The above screenshot was my implementation of the Minesweeper game in Python, as coded <a href="https://github.com/quanhuynh/DailyProgrammer/tree/master/other/minesweeper"> here </a></h5><img src="../../assets/img/work/work-3/img4.png" alt="Langton's Ant"/>
<h5 class="text-left">This is the result of a simulation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langton%27s_ant"> Langton's Ant </a>, but modified to <a href="https://github.com/quanhuynh/DailyProgrammer/tree/master/intermediate/173-langtons-ant"> my liking </a>. This particular image resulted from 12 million generations of Langton's Ant.</h5>
<h5 class="text-left">I plan on continuing doing these challenges in the future. I enjoy doing them and they have taught me a lot of what I know now. </h5>
