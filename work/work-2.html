<h5 class="text-left">I built a static website for MC Nails LLC., a local business dedicated to beauty care.</h5>
<h5 class="text-left">The most important features I had in mind included an easy-to-use navigation bar, smooth flow of information, and priority of information. Necessary information such as hours, contact, and location shouldn't be put in another page, so I integrated them into the home page itself (hours of operation is even integrated into the navigation bar).</h5>
<h5 class="text-left">Smooth flow of information means that I present the reader with enough information but I don't take multiple viewports to do so. Each of the sections take up about one whole viewport, more or less.</h5><img src="../../assets/img/work/work-2/img2.jpg" alt="MC Nails"/>
<h5 class="text-left">The navigation bar is implemented across all pages of the website. It is also fixed and scrolls with the reader.</h5>
<h5 class="text-left">This website is also mobile-responsive, with the most important changes being the position of the navigation bar and the collapsible menu</h5><img src="../../assets/img/work/work-2/img3.jpg" alt="MC Nails"/>
<h5 class="text-left">I built this page using the Bootstrap framework with usage of jQuery. AngularJS was used to build the Services page.</h5>
<h5 class="text-left">The site can be found <a href="http://mcnails.org"> here </a></h5>
