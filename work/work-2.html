<h3 class="text-left"><strong> About </strong></h3>
<h5 class="text-left">I built a static website for MC Nails LLC., a local business dedicated to beauty care. The website is a tool for the business to be reached by customers, as an addition to its Yelp and Facebook page. The site provides information on pricing, location, services, and ultimately, is a marketing tool. </h5>
<h3 class="text-left"><strong> Design and Implementation </strong></h3>
<h5 class="text-left">The most important features I had in mind included an easy-to-use navigation bar, smooth flow of information, and priority of information. Necessary information such as hours, contact, and location shouldn't be put in another page, so I integrated them into the home page itself (hours of operation is even integrated into the navigation bar).</h5>
<h5 class="text-left">Smooth flow of information means that I present the reader with enough information but I don't take multiple viewports to do so. Each of the sections take up about one whole viewport, more or less.</h5><img src="../../assets/img/work/work-2/img2.jpg" alt="MC Nails"/>
<h5 class="text-left">The navigation bar is implemented across all pages of the website. It is also fixed and scrolls with the reader for easy navigation but also for style points. This website is also mobile-responsive, with the most important changes being the position of the navigation bar and the collapsible menu.</h5><img src="../../assets/img/work/work-2/img3.jpg" alt="MC Nails"/>
<h5 class="text-left">The page was built on a Bootstrap framework, with implementation of jQuery for animations and smooth navigation. In the Services page, I used AngularJS to organize the data for the price list.</h5>
<h3 class="text-left"><strong> What I Learned </strong></h3>
<h5 class="text-left">This was the first web dev project I did for someone other than myself, so obviously it was important to not mess anything up. I took a careful approach in designing and implementing the website. I learned how to organize my own workflow, from the design process on Photoshop to the actual implementation.</h5>
<h5 class="text-left">Moreover, I had the chance to tinker with new technologies, such as jQuery and AngularJS. While they were not used extensively due to the static nature of the site, it was fascinating to work with them, and I hope to be using them soon in the future.</h5>
